Every morning, my friend wakes up early to watch the sun rise. While most people are still asleep, she finds a quiet place—sometimes a balcony, sometimes a park bench—and watches the first light of day peek over the horizon. She says it gives her a sense of peace and purpose. Watching the sun come up reminds her that each day is a new beginning. The soft light, the fresh air, and the calm silence help her start the day with clarity. I admire her for that. It’s not just a habit; it’s a way of grounding herself before the world gets busy.
